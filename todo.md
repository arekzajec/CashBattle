## Roadmap

Current issues and directions for future development

### Functinal

* one-to-one question mode
* extend number of teams to N (but I cannot believe that person can follow licitiation with N > 5)

### Graphical

* better icons for `up`, `down` and `enter` in `Operator Panel`
* number of displayed teams depends on number participating (in `Game Window`)
* more estetical view in `Operator Panel`
* rework of scaling: `Game Window` and `Operator Panel` depends from screen resolution (either automaticly detected or as an arguments)

### Quality of code

* revisit and refactor naming
    * are names descriptive and not in polish/ponglish
    * are naming convention for class, objects, functions and variables (camelCase, snake_case, etc.) coherent
* better hermetisation (espesially `GEngine`)

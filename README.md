## `*.que` file description
Every question should be in separate line described as
```bash
category; question; correct_answer; incorrect_answer1; incorrect_answer2; incorrect_answer3; name_of_wav_file; is_used; comment
```
`name_of_wav_file` is a path (or part of the path, see option `-P` for common dictionary) to `.wav` file, without extension.

`is_used` is a boolean (`0` or `1`) that indicates if question was used before and will **not** be used again.

All empty lines in `.que` files are ignored. Program use empty line in output file to separate yet-to-use questions from used or filtered out questions. However, for correct conversion to `.json` using `scripts/que2json` `.que` file must be ended by newline.
